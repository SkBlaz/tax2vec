But  it  addresses  logistic  realities  of  petitions.\n\nWe  would  need  a  bit  of  a  discussion  of  what  text  we  want.  It  has  to  be  very  cogent.\nYou  have  seen  my  very  roughly  written  theme.But  maybe  a  much  simplified  call  to  boycott  the  Russian  2014  Olympics  would  be  best.Consider  how  THAT  could  be  publicized  at  the  London  Olympics  by  the  British  Syrians!\n\nOr  a  call  to  cancel  the  Russian  Olympics  altogether.  That  would  go  to  the  Olympic  Committee,  which  is  a  dead  end.  \xa0They  have  no  objections  to  tyrants.  "They  is  one".\n\nBut  we  would  have  to  decide  who  we  want  to  deliver  the  petition  to,  and  that  shapes  the  wording  of  the\xa0\nAnd  it  would  be  good  to  consult  with  a  few  other  key  people.  \xa0We  would  not  need  to  have  unanimity,  but  we  would  need  to  know  if  "Syrian  Campaigns"  and  others  are  thinking  of  doing  the  same  thing.  \xa0The  situation  now  in  Syria  is  such,  so  close  to  the  tipping  point,  that  every  little  project  can  help  leverage  the  collapse  of  the  regime.That  is  why  I  signed  the  petition  to  refer  Assad  to  the  ICC,  even  though  I  would  prefer  to  simply  lynch  him  in  the  streets  of  Damascus  and  display  his  body  in  every  town  of  the  land.  \xa0Just  my  initial  thoughts.\xa0Grammar  pickers  please  note  that  I  used  the  modal  subjunctive  "would"  and  "could",  to  indicate  possibility,  not  fact."

1	"Randal,  regarding  your  first  paragraph  above,  what  articulett  said!\n\nRegarding  you  second  paragraph,  you  really  don't  see  what  you  are  forced  to  do  here,  do  you?  It's  what  I  see  you  arguing  on  your  blog  and  in  our  co-written  book.  You  stretch  things  to  suit  what  you  believe.  You  use  improbabilities  to  conclude  a  probability.  You  do  this  all  of  the  time,  almost  in  every  case.  \n\nTake  my  speculation  that  most  non-believers,  especially  former  Christians,  have  heard  many  of  the  \nthings  you  say  in  this  book,  but  most  Christians  have  not  considered  the  \nthings  I  say  in  it.  (that's  how  I  meant  the  sentence  per  aritculett).\n\nFirst  off,  when  it  comes  to  FORMER  CHRISTIANS  we  were  scared  to  death  to  seriously  doubt  our  faith.  We  were  scared  because  of  the  threat  of  hell  if  we  get  it  wrong.  You  probably  do  not  understand  this.  When  the  time  comes  for  you  to  seriously  doubt  your  faith  you  will  understand  it.  At  that  point  you  must  be  convinced  your  faith  has  almost  no  probability  to  it  at  all  in  order  to  reject  it,  since  that  is  the\xa0  point  where  Pascal's  Wager  has  no  more  force  on  us.  So  we  investigated  it  thoroughly,  most  of  us.  The  more  educated  we  are  in  our  faith  then  the  more  we  must  investigate  it.  So  it's  more  likely  what  you  have  said  in  our  book  will  be  things  most  former  Christians  have  considered  before.\n\nI  have  a  mountain  of  anecdotal  evidence  for  this  as  well.  Almost  every  Christian  I  have  spoken  to  always  learns  something  from  me  and  I  have  learned  little  or  nothing  from  them.  This  scenario  repeats  itself  every  time  I  have  a  disunion  with  a  Christian,  and  can  be  seen  from  the  responses  to  my  blog  over  a  six  and  a  half  year  period.  I  teach  them.  They  do  not  teach  me.\n\nWhen  it  comes  to  NON-BELIEVERS  in  general  studies  have  shown  that  non-believers  know  more  about  the  Bible  than  Christians.  That's  evidence,  baby.  The  probability  therefore\xa0  that  non-believers  will  not  learn  as  much  from  you  in  our  book  is  more  likely,  than  otherwise.\n\nSo  these  speculations  of  mine  have  evidence  for  them.  Evidence.  That's  what  I'm  talking  about,  here,  there,  and  in  our  co-written  book.  You  must  skirt  it  at  almost  every  step  in  order  to  believe.  \n\nAnd  you  provide  some  evidence  that  this  is  what  you  do  here.  You  compared  the  probabilities  of  my  speculations  with  predicting  how  many  people  will  get  rained  on  next  February  18th.  I  did  not  say  how  many  believers  would  learn  more  from  me  than  you,  nor  did  I  speculate  how  many  skeptics  would  not  learn  as  much  from  you.  I  only  speculated  than  MOST  believers  would  learn  more  from  me.  Most,  as  defined  as  above  50%,  minimally.  You  however  compared  my  speculations  with  prediction  of  how  many  people  would  get  rained  on  next  February  18th.  That's  asking  someone  to  specify  a  mathematical  number  of  people  who  will  get  rained  on.  You  are  also  asking  for  the  impossible,  or  the  near  impossible,  since  no  one  can  predict  what  the  weather  will  be  like  on  one  part  of  the  planet  seven  months  from  now  (charitably  assuming  that's  your  comparison  rather  than  asking  someone  to  predict  the  number  of  people  who  will  get  rained  on  globally).  w\n\n*ahem*  there  is  absolutely  NO  comparative  parity  here  at  all.\n\nThis  is  what  I  see  you  do  all  of  the  time.\n\nThe  unfortunate  thing  is  that  I  have  to  spend  15-20  minutes  explaining  this  to  your  deluded  mind.  That's  a  waste  of  your  mind  in  my  opinion,  a  waste  of  an  otherwise  bright  mind  who  would  never  use  it  in  like  this  in  any  other  area  of  life  except  when  it  comes  to  your  faith.\n\nNot  only  that,  but  I  predict  you  are  not  done  defending  this  utterly  ignorant  comparison.\n\nYou  do  realize  that  I've  stopped  wasting  so  much  time  blogging  because  of  Christan  like  you,  correct?  Your  reasoning  abilities  when  it  comes  to  your  faith  is  just  that  bad,  sorry.  I  have  no  hopes  of  convincing  you  jsut  as  I  have  no  hopes  of  convincing  a  leader  in  Scientology.  You  cannot  be  argued  out  of  your  faith  because  you  were  never  reasoned  into  it  in  the  first  place.\n\nThere  is  only  hope  for  others."

Honestly,  most  of  the  weight  that  you'll  lose  is  going  to  be  water  and  maybe  a  little  bit  of  muscle  and  fat  if  you  are  very  careful  with  your  calories.  You  can  also  be  certain  that  you'll  gain  it  back  again  once  you  get  of  the  diet.  I'd  recommend  that  to  take  it  slow  and  easy  so  you  can  see  the  long-term  benefits.  \\n\\n  \\n\\nI've  personally  lost  180lbs  since  Dec  2009.  My  blood  pressure  was  160/110,  now  its  120/80.  My  cholesterol  was  256  mg/dL,  now  its  176mg/dL.  I'm  no  longer  Pre-Diabetic  and  I'm  in  the  best  shape  of  my  life.

Put  it  this  way,  as  someone  who  is  actively  involved  in  the  systematic  elimination  of  other  human  beings,  I  totally  understand  how  all  this  movie  shit  really  aint  that  important  in  the  grand  scheme  of  things.  However,  I  and  others  in  a  similar  situation  use  them  to  decompress  from  that  real  shit,  and  more  often  than  not  movies  help  express  stuff  in  ways  only  film  can.  It  does  have  value.\nAnd  to  your  hypothetical  situation  about  the  victim  using  faith  to  survive,  I  would  recount  the  <i>very  real</i>  examples  of  young  afghan  girls  getting  their  faces  mutilated  by  their  own  family  over  irrational  outdated  customs/religious  beliefs.  Is  it  better  to  have  faith  that  produces  these  atrocites.  I  don't  know,  I  dont  have  an  answer.  Alls  I  know  is  although  I  thoroughly  disagree  with  the  absolute  abolition  of  religion,  its  very  obvious  that  we  have  to  find  a  way  to  evolve  our  thought  processes.  \nOh,  and  as  far  as  movie  related  articles  are  concerned,  Scientology  is  famously  a  very  big  force  in  the  entertainment  industry,  as  many  of  the  big  name  A-list  actors  follow  that  faith.  I  think  it  warrants  discussion.  And  don't  forget,  theres  a  movie  coming  out  later  this  year  about  the  Hubbard,  the  trailer  for  which  was  covered  recently  here.

1	"You  goofy  Repub  thugs  don't  have  a  clue,  not  the  tiniest  shred  of  a  fact  on  how  health  care  works  in  most  other  countries  around  the  globe.  The  US  is  the  only  developed  country  without  universal,  single-payer  or  socialized  medical  care  for  all  its  citizens.  Some  systems  differ,  but  all  achieve  near  100%  access  to  a  doctor  and  hospital  at  way  lower  cost  than  we  here  in  The  United  States  of  America.  In  some  countries,  people  pay  some  small  amount  per  doctor  visit,  like  a  co-pay.  In  other  countries,  you  are  covered,  no  co-pay.  In  most  countries,  the  option  to  have  private  health  insurance  is  always  an  option.  This  gives  the  wealthy  or  well-heeded  access  to  some  private  doctors  who  want  to  only  see  rich  patients.  Their  choice.  \nBut  no  one,  no  mom,  dad,  child,  uncle,  aunt,  grandma,  grandpa,  sister,  brother,  business  associate,  boss,  garbage  man,  ditch  digger,  or  nuclear  physicist  goes  bankrupt  from  a  disease  or  medical  condition  like  here  in  the  USA.  You  need  not  fear  the  collection  agency  coming  after  you  because  you  fell  and  broke  your  arm  and  had  no  insurance.  No  insurance  company  denies  your  claim  or  drops  your  coverage  after  finding  out  you  have  cancer  or  heart  disease  or  MS.  Get  it?  \n\nWe  are  in  the  dark  ages  of  medical  care  in  the  US  and  the  Neanderthal  republicans  want  to  keep  it  that  way  because  their  wealthy  benefactors  in  the  giant  Insurance-Pharma  industrial  complex  like  it  that  way.  These  craven  business  people  who  lust  after  profits  like  an  alcoholic  lusts  for  a  drink,  make  huge  boatloads  of  cash  and  mega  profits  off  us  and  do  not  want  that  gravy  train  to  stop."

He  spurred  the  creation  of  the  tea  party.  He  helped  the  GOP  win  the  House  majority  in  2010  and  make  big  gains  in  the  Senate.  His  Obamacare  has  helped  revive  the  Commerce  Clause  and  given  a  boost  to  conservative  jurisprudence.  His  refusal  to  support  human  rights  has  caused  a  bipartisan  revulsion  and  reminded  us  that  foreign  policy  must  be  girded  by  American  values.  He\u2019s  sent  independents  running  into  the  GOP\u2019s  arms.  He\u2019s  forced  conservatives  to  think  hard  and  express  eloquently  principles  of  religious  liberty,  limited  government,  free  markets  and  Constitutional  democracy.\n\nObama  also  has  wreaked  havoc  in  the  the  Democratic  Party.  He\u2019s  firmly  affixed  the  \u201ctax  and  spend\u201d  label  to  it  after  Bill  Clinton  declared  that  the  era  of  big  government  was  over.  He\u2019s  made  Clinton  into  a  pitch  man  for  Mitt  Romney.  His  rejection  of  the  Keystone  XL  pipeline  has  split  the  party.  His  refusal  to  adopt  the  Simpson-Bowles  commission\u2019s  recommendations  has  turned  Democrats  into  reactionaries,  defending  the  status  quo  on  entitlements.  He\u2019s  alienated  Jewish  voters.  He\u2019s  re-McGovernized  the  party,  which  now  stands  for  appeasing  despotic  powers,  turning  on  allies  and  slashing  defense  spending.\n\n(Pack  it  up  dude,  your  eviction  notice  will  be  delivered  in  November)"

I  really  am.  What  happens  in  your  life,  in  your  car  and  in  your  marriage  should  not  be  a  public  issue.  Unfortunately,  because  you  are  a  public  figure,  sometimes  your  private  life  does  become  public.  I  guess  it  comes  with  the  territory  and  maybe  you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re  used  to  it  by  now.  It  still  must  bite,  though......Of  course  I  long  for  you  to  own  your  mistakes,  Tiger.  If  you  aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t  already,  and  I  hope  you  are,  man  up  to  the  pain  you  caused  your  wife  and  family.  Let  the  hot  searing  anger  she  has  for  what  you  did  change  you,  not  harden  you.  It  must  be  a  hard  road  to  walk,  both  for  her  dealing  with  what  you  have  done,  and  for  you,  making  sense  of  where  to  go  from  here  when  you  are  in  the  public  eye  the  way  you  are.  Stand  behind  your  actions  by  way  of  fully  admitting  and  acknowledging  them  to  yourself.  Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t  lie  to  yourself  or  pretend  they  aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t  as  bad  as  others  think  or  that  somehow  you  were  justified.  You  weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.  You  are  reaping  what  you  sowed,  Tiger.  Own  it.  But  see,  whether  you  acknowledge  all  that  publicly  to  your  fans  is  entirely  up  to  you.  It  makes  no  difference  to  me  if  your  public  apologies  are  detailed  or  not.  For  it  is  not  us  you  need  to  be  apologizing  to.  Because  you  are  well  known  does  not  make  you  accountable  to  the  public.  Share  only  what  you  want,  and  keep  the  rest  private.  Keep  it  all  private,  if  you  can.  But,  and  I  speak  from  painful  experience  here,  coming  entirely  clean  does  feel  good.  Really  good....\\n\\nTonight,  I  am  praying  for  restoration  for  your  marriage.  Having  almost  lost  mine,  because  of  my  own  sin  and  pride  as  well  as  that  of  my  husband,  I  now  hold  redemption  in  marriage  in  such  high  regard....But  my  advice,  as  someone  who  has  been  there?  Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t  hide  it.  Own  it.  Embrace  it.  Learn  from  it.  Change  your  ways.  Feel  repentance.  Apologize  to  your  wife.  Seek  counseling,  lots  of  it  if  you  can.  Let  the  searing  pain  and  guilt  and  remorse  you  hopefully  feel  inspire  in  you  to  see  yourself  for  what  you  are:  A  wretched  sinner  in  need  of  forgiveness.\\n\\nYou,  your  heart,  and  that  of  your  wife  and  children  are  what  matter.  Focus  on  them,  on  saving  your  marriage,  if  that  is  what  you  want  to  do.  And  truly,  my  husband  and  I  pray  that  it  is  what  you  want  to  do."\\n\\n"

We  know  he  was  shot  from  between  1  and  18  inches,  in  the  chest,  which  is  consistent  with  Zimmerman's  story.    Trayvon  had  at  least  a  few  seconds  of  life  after  he  was  shot,  and  who  knows  what  his  reaction  was...    judging  from  how  his  body  was  found,  he  crawled  off  Zimmerman  and  died.

I  will  not  be  supporting  SGK  any  longer.  There  are  many  places  that  are  more  focused  in  their  mission  to  help  all  women,  Planned  Parenthood  is  one  of  them.  When  I  was  a  starving  college  student,  PP  was  my  primary  health  screener.  Later  I  did  volunteer  work  at  PP  to  pay  back  for  my  healthcare;  one  of  the  things  we  were  trained  on  was  how  to  check  yourself  for  lumps  and  why  it  was  important.  They  have  been  consistent  in  their  mission  to  help  all  women  stay  alive  and  healthy  often  during  the  most  dire  of  times."

Wow.  As  far  as  "Stop  trivializing  violence"  goes.  Why  dont  you  stop  sounding  like  a  big  ass  c***  sucker  and  don\\'t  play  games  with  violence  then.  I  get  so  tired  of  all  these  holy  sounding  types  that  get  touchy  about  video  game  violence.\\n\\n  I\\'ve  seen  Blood  Diamond  a  dozen  times  with  the  kids  killing  and  getting  killed  and  it  doesn\\'t  even  phase  me  one  bit  only  because  its  not  real,  sure  there  is  an  emotional  sense  there  but  not  enough  to  make  me  write  to  Hollywood  saying  gay  sh*t  like  Stop  trivializing  violence  because  its  disgusting.  Why  does  a  game  have  to  tone  it  down  when  movies  don\\'t?  I\\'m  not  defending  COD  in  the  slightest,  and  that\\'s  because  I  don\\'t  really  care  about  the  game.  But  when  I  read  the  headline  of  the  article  I  was  curious  to  see  what  others  were  going  to  say,  but  I  knew  hands  down  it  was  going  to  be  an  attempt  to  throw  punches  at  a  series  that  has  sold  a  lot  of  copies  already.  All  I  can  say  is,  it  doesn\\'t  matter  how  "YOU"  feel  when  every  other  gamer  that  plays  the  game  probably  can  just  deal  with  the  game  no  matter  if  it  changes  or  not.\\n\\n  Sitting  on  your  overgrown  ass  complaining  about  a  game  being  this  and  being  that  just  because  you  don\\'t  like  it  is  stupid  as  hell.  I  hate  JRPG  games  and  why  I  also  hate  Anime  with  a  passion  because  I  can\\'t  stand  cute  crap,  I  hate  that  overly  sensitive  BS  with  the  characters,  I  don\\'t  like  Japanese  music  either  unless  its  instrumental  War  drums  or  something  out  of  Samurai  Warriors  or  Kessen  where  it  doesn\\'t  begin  and  end  with  a  stupid  Asian  chick  trying  to  sound  like  shes  an  innocent  little  annoying  11  or  13  year  old...I  hate  high  pitch  whiny  sounding  voices  too  and  no  Japanese  voice  acting  does  not  mean  better  over  American  voice  acting  because  it  still  sucks  regardless.  \\n\\nBut  I  don\\'t  go  near  the  stuff  (even  though  my  brother  plays  JRPG  games  a  lot,  and  that  means  I  can\\'t  really  escape  it  when  we\\'re  both  in  the  same  room  and  I\\'m  studying  while  he\\'s  just  playing  his  sissy  games).  The  fact  still  stands  that  I  don\\'t  INTENTIONALLY  go  near  things  I  hate  just  so  I  can  whine  about  hating  it  like  COD  haters  constantly  go  near  Call  of  Duty  to  claim  that  they  hate  the  game  when  its  easier  to  just  simply  stay  away  from  it,  don\\'t  buy  it,  try  to  pretend  like  it  doesn\\'t  even  exist.  I  will  not  lie  to  anybody.  I  like  violence  in  my  games.  People  that  walk  around  with  a  d*ck  up  there  ass  crying  foul  about  CGI  characters  dying  and  getting  hurt  probably  scream  when  the  doctor  comes  at  them  with  a  needle.  As  far  as  Call  of  Duty  having  to  change  goes.  Well,  that  depends  on  whether  or  not  a  lot  of  people  want  it  to  change,  and  not  just  the  people  that  bash  the  game  on  a  consistent  basis  either.  I\\'m  talking  about  people  that  really  feel  or  believe  it  should  change  a  few  things  and  have  accurate  reasons  why.  Just  simply  saying  "COD  is  for  13  year  olds  and  needs  to  change  this  or  that"...If  anything  the  COD  players  are  the  ones  that  should  change."

The  community  simply  decided,  to  turn  thier  back  when  ever  he  appeared,  close  thier  pubs,  stores,  once  he  pulled  up.  'Shunned'  Thus  the  word  'boycott'  enter  the  english  language.  The  point,  if  you  feel  that  strongly,  organize  a  society  response  to  his  films  and  other  work,  independent  of  it's  intrinsic  qualities.  \\nHere  in  Brazil,  there  is  a  culture  of  deflowering  teens  and  preteen  girls,  by  the  nationals  here,  for  foreigners  they  are  sent  to  prison.\\nThis  is  often  done  by  fathers  and  grandfathers,  the  patriarch  of  the  family.  Said  to  have  originated  in  ancient  Rome,  the  film  BraveHearth  made  reference  to  first  night,  where  the  lord  of  the  area  do  some  form  of  this  power  sex  on  minors  in  thier  dominion.  West  Virginia,  comes  to  mind,  as  this  power  sex  folklore  is  said  to  be  in  epidemic  proportions,  these  daughters  get  deflowered  in  house,  first,  sound  familia.  Are  you  going  to  'boycitt'  the  state  of  West  Virginia?  \\nClearly  Morgan  has  crossed  the  lines,  of  our  sensibilities,  our  Puritan  morals,  and  our  expectation  of  decency,  so  did  George  W.  Bush,    with  his  Hurricane  Catrina  etc.,  and  Bill  Clinton  with  his  oval  office  dick  sucking,  episode  of  his  intern.\\nThese  are/were    actual  Presidents  of  these  united  States.  Do  you  have  the  right  to  impose  your  morals  on  consenting  adults  within  the  law?  We  all  have  the  answer  to  this?  What  freekie  things  are  you  doing?

0	"Video:  Breitbart  vs.  Cenk  Uygar  over  rape  at  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOccupy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  camps\\nposted  at  9:52  pm  on  February  14,  2012  by  Allahpundit\\n\\nVia  Breitbart  TV.  I  should  have  guessed  that  eventually  we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d  be  arguing  over  whether  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOccupy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  has  a  problem  with  crime,  notwithstanding  the  long,  long,  long,  long,  long  list  of  alleged  criminal  activities  at  the  encampaments.  Remember,  things  at  Zuccotti  Park  got  so  bad  that  a  women-only  tent  was  set  up  so  that  there\\xe2\\x80\\x99d  be  strength  in  numbers  against  sexual  predators.  Some  feminist  sites  criticized  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOccupy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  for  its  rape  problem  back  during  the  movement\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  brief  heyday;  even  HuffPo  reported  on  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmultiple  incidents  of  assault,  drug  dealing  and  drug  use,  rape  and  attempted  rape,  according  to  conversations  with  numerous  protesters.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  (Per  Breitbart  in  the  clip,  that  detail  apparently  didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t  make  it  into  their  book.)  And  of  course,  we  only  know  about  some  of  what  went  on.  At  least  one  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOccupy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  camp  reminded  victims  that  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe  do  not  encourage  the  involvement  of  the  police  in  our  community\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  and  a  New  York  City  cop  told  Big  Journalism\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Joel  Pollak  that  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere  are  many  incidents  of  sexual  touching  and  groping  that  goes  unreported  to  us,  mainly  because  the  alleged  victim  is  either  too  stoned  or  high  to  properly  ID  them  or  they  \\xe2\\x80\\x98dont  want  to  get  the  guy  in  trouble.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  (Some  national  media  outlets  reported  on  the  attacks  too.)  This  is  why,  of  course,  Breitbart  was  yelling  at  the  Occupiers  outside  CPAC  to  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstop  raping  people,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  but  now  that  the  movement  is  gearing  up  for  a  big  spring  comeback,  I  guess  it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  time  for  the  left\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  whitewash  to  being  in  earnest.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  a  nice  bookend  to  their  demagoguery  over  the  Tucson  shooting:  In  that  case,  tea  partiers  were  blamed  for  a  crime  that  no  tea  partier  committed  whereas  here  no  Occupiers  are  blamed  for  a  crime  that  quite  a  few  Occupiers  allegedly  committed.  Fourteen  minutes,  but  well  worth  it.\\n\\nvideo\\n\\nhttp://hotair.com/archives/2012/02/14/video-breitbart-vs-cenk-uygar-over-rape-at-occupy-camps/"

Real  Americans  always  reject  unnatural  things  like  eyeglasses,  polyester,  and  air  conditioning.\\n02)  Gay  marriage  will  encourage  people  to  be  gay,  in  the  same  way  that  hanging  around  tall  people  will  make  you  tall.\\n03)  Legalizing  gay  marriage  will  open  the  door  to  all  kinds  of  crazy  behavior.  People  may  even  wish  to  marry  their  pets  because  a  dog  has  legal  standing  and  can  sign  a  marriage  contract.\\n04)  Straight  marriage  has  been  around  a  long  time  and  hasn't  changed  at  all;  women  are  still  property,  blacks  still  can't  marry  whites,  and  divorce  is  still  illegal.\\n05)  Straight  marriage  will  be  less  meaningful  if  gay  marriage  were  allowed;  the  sanctity  of  Britany  Spears'  55-hour  just-for-fun  marriage  would  be  destroyed.\\n06)  Straight  marriages  are  valid  because  they  produce  children.  Gay  couples,  infertile  couples,  and  old  people  shouldn't  be  allowed  to  marry  because  our  orphanages  aren't  full  yet,  and  the  world  needs  morechildren.\\n07)  Obviously  gay  parents  will  raise  gay  children,  since  straight  parents  only  raise  straight  children.\\n08)  Gay  marriage  is  not  supported  by  religion.  In  a  theocracy  like  ours,the  values  of  one  religion  are  imposed  on  the  entire  country.  That's  why  we  have  only  one  religion  in  America.\\n09)  Children  can  never  succeed  without  a  male  and  a  female  role  model  at  home.  That's  why  we  as  a  society  expressly  forbid  single  parents  to  raise  children.\\n10)  Gay  marriage  will  change  the  foundation  of  society;  we  could  never  adapt  to  new  social  norms.  Just  like  we  haven't  adapted  to  cars,  the  service-sector  economy,  or  longer  life  spans."

She  claims  she  did  it  because  the  program  allowed  hundreds  of  thousands  of  low-income  families  to  become  homeowners.  .News  of  this  latest  scandal  comes  as  the  House  Ethics  Committee  prepares  to  try  Waters  for  using  her  influence  to  steer  $12  million  in  federal  bailout  funds  to  a  failing  bank  (that  subsequently  got  shut  down  by  the  government)  in  which  she  and  her  board  member  husband  held  shares.  .A  few  months  ago  the  congresswoman  got  in  trouble  again  for  skirting  federal  elections  rules  with  a  crooked  fundraising  gimmick  that  allows  her  to  receive  unlimited  amounts  of  donations  from  certain  contributors.  Instead  of  raising  most  of  her  campaign  funds  from  individuals  and  political  action  committees,  Waters  sells  her  endorsement  to  other  politicians  and  political  causes  for  as  much  as  $45,000  a  pop,  allowing  her  to  rake  in  hundreds  of  thousands  of  dollars  in  short  periods  of  time.  **************Neil  Goldschmidt  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  Democrat  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  Oregon  governor.

You  need  us  to  tell  you  that  your  husband  would  rather  fuck  a  barbed  wire  covered  glory  hole  than  touch  your  53  year  old  moldy  vagina.  You  need  us  to  tell  you  about  the  health  problems  your  poor  children  are  going  to  suffer  thanks  to  your  fast  food  and  brownie  diet.  Poor  tweenie  is  going  to  be  teased  in  school  for  being  tubby.  You  need  us  to  tell  you  how  stupid  you  are  to  go  off  of  a  fucking  car  thermometer  to  determine  the  outside  temperature  and  then  compare  it  to  a  fucking  tropical  climate  state  like  Florida.  How  the  hell  do  you  function  in  life?  Oh  wait,  you  dont.  You  sit  your  fat  worthless  ass  at  a  computer  all  day  ranting  about  gay  marriage.  I  hate  to  break  it  to  you  but  I  guarantee  your  darling  son  Sam  is  going  to  grow  up  to  be  the  butt  pirate  you  so  hate.  What  are  you  going  to  do  then?  Throw  a  bible  at  his  head?  It  wont  knock  the  gay  out  of  him!  Even  worse  little  Sara  is  going  to  grow  up  to  be  a......LIBERAL!  Gasp!  Oh  nos!  So  your  tweenie  is  going  to  be  a  fatty,  sammy  a  gay,  and  sara  a  tree  hugging  hippie!  Looks  like  your  "christian"  mothering  sucks  and  you  should  try  another  route.
