Now,  I  don\\'t  mean  that  the  Archangel  Gabriel  will  appear  out  of  the  East  to  scourge  the  administration  with  a  blazing  sword,  though  I  would  pay  to  see  that.    What  I\\'m  saying  is  that  <strong>Obama  has  at  last  taken  the  step  that  we  all  knew  he  had  in  him,  the  ultimate  act  of  arrogance  and  contempt  that  will  bring  the  forces  of  history  down  upon  him.</strong>\\n\\nThe  left  has  always  underestimated  the  Catholic  Church.    "<strong>How  many  divisions  has  the  pope?"  Stalin  once  asked  Molotov,  mocking  the  Church\\'s  powerlessness  in  the  modern  era.    He  was  not  around  to  see  John  Paul  II  rend  the  Bolshevik  kingdom  in  twain  at  the  climax  of  the  Cold  War,  utilizing  the  only  forces  he  required:  moral  certainty  and  absolute  faith  in  the  divine  mission.</strong>    Most  American  leftists  are  a  little  different,  viewing  the  Church  as  an  anachronism,  obsessed  with  medieval  ideas  having  no  place  in  the  third  millennium  and  populated  with  strange  figures  in  outmoded  clothing,  if  not  with  an  endless  parade  of  child-molesters.    \\n\\n<strong>What  they  overlook  is  two  thousand  years  of  history</strong>.    An  organization  does  not  survive  for  that  length  of  time  --  and  no  other  organization  has  --  without  internalizing  things  not  completely  understood  by  even  the  deepest  thinkers  among  us.    <strong>\\n\\nThe  Church  survived  the  fall  of  Rome,  the  barbarians,  the  first  Muslim  upsurge,  several  schisms,  the  Renaissance  princes,  the  20th-century  totalitarians,  and  its  own  plunges  into  decadence,  and  it  will  also  survive  modernism.</strong>    Which  is  in  fact  what  it  confronts  in  Obama:  a  man  of  vast  though  superficial  sophistication  and  little  insight  who  has  punched  all  the  tickets  available  to  him  in  his  epoch  and  culture  and  truly  believes  there  is  nothing  else.  <strong>  And  now  this  man,  afraid  of  revealing  his  own  college  transcripts,  thinks  he  can  take  on  the  Church  of  Peter,  founded  a  millennium  before  the  appearance  of  any  nation  now  existing  on  this  earth.</strong>\\n\\n\\nRead  more:  http://www.americanthinker.com/2012/02/whom_the_gods_would_destroy.html#ixzz1mKnbY0d3"

0	"@jsdavis13  True.  You'd  think  that  the  Christians  who  are  so  hell  bent  into  forcing  religion  into  public  life  would  be  using  it  to  do  the  things  Jesus  talked  about.  He  never  said  a  word  about  gays  or  when  the  soul  enters  the  body.  He  spent  all  of  his  time  hanging  out  with  prostitutes  and  the  poorest  of  the  poor  telling  rich  people  it  would  be  very  hard  for  them  to  get  into  heaven.  Remember  the  sermon  about  when  I  was  hungry  you  did  not  feed  me,  because  what  you  do  for  the  least  of  these  you  also  do  unto  me?  I  don't  much  think  Jesus  cares  how  we  care  for  each  other,  as  long  as  we  do.  A  hungry  kid  doesn't  care  if  dinner  came  from  food  stamps  or  from  a  loving  donation.  My  guess  is  he  would  not  think  highly  of  a  society  that  leaves  issues  like  hunger  and  medical  care  to  the  whims  of  its  donor  class."

I  kind  of  agree  with  the  being  a  SmackDown  star  thought  though  eventually  I  think  Bryan  should  have  a  legit  shot  at  the  title.  Maybe  just  blatantly  move  him  to  Raw,  so  he  can.  And  please  don't  mention  Tensai.  The  guy  is  not  ready  to  challenge  Punk  for  the  title  and  hopefully  never  will  be,\n\n2.  Ew,  Big  Show?  Even  when  I  used  to  despise  Show  for  his  booking,  I  would  never  say  ew.  Seriously,  who  says  that?\n\n3.  None  of  you  guys  really  pointed  out  the  fact  that  this  is  only  falling  in  line  for  Jericho.  He  won't  come  back  immediately.  He  is  touring  with  Fozzy  now  and  will  be  gone  a  lot  of  the  summer.  The  only  one  who  is  hurt  is  Orton  who  we  get  to  right  afterwards.\n\n4.  Wait,  why  are  we  talking  about  two  newcomers  getting  their  very  first  PPV  match  against  the  face  of  SmackDown?  Sandow  and  Cesaro  are  not  at  a  point  that  they  should  be  wrestling  against  Orton.  Miz  would  be  a  good  choice  if  he  weren't  falling  so  far  and  so  fast  lately.  I  stand  by  Ziggler  or  Judas'  idea  of  having  Orton  be  the  special  guest  referee.\n\n5.  Raw  had  at  least  the  Punk/Bryan  segment.  Also,  when  you  say  there  is  no  tag  team  division,  you  seem  to  miss  the  fact  that  the  division  is  in  full  rebuild  right  now.  Everyone  from  the  Usos  to  Darren  Young  and  Titus  O'Neil  to  Hawkins  and  Reks  to  the  AW  stable  is  stepping  up  and  finding  a  place.  In  fact,  the  least  fluid  team  right  now  might  be  the  champions  who  still  don't  feel  like  a  real  tag  team  or  a  serious  threat.  As  far  as  SmackDown  vs.  Impact,  I  agreed  with  the  guys  on  Impact,  but  you  guys  are  sometimes  underscoring  SmackDown  which  was  very  solid  story-wise  and  especially  wrestling-wise.\n\n6.  Yeah,  obvious  the  TNA  move  was  positive  while  the  Raw  move  is  polarizing.\n\n7.  Wow,  a  lot  of  Hogan  lovers.  "He  made  the  show  better."  "Best  mic  work  of  his  career."  What?  Hogan  was  great  on  the  mic  in  the  80s  and  90s.  He  has  not  improved.  He  has  lost  his  wits  and  charisma  for  the  most  part.  Laurinaitis  plays  his  role  to  perfection,  and  he  brought  about  the  great  Extreme  Rules  PPV.  He  is  a  long  term  storyline,  taking  over  the  company  one  step  at  a  time.  Hogan  has  not  improved  programming.  The  creative  team  has  just  come  up  with  a  couple  good  ideas  since  Hogan  arrived.  Sorry,  but  at  least  Laurinaitis  doesn't  have  an  easy  replacement.\n\n8.  Btw,  Sean,  you  aren't  ahead  of  me  anymore.  I  went  for  a  perfect  20  at  Over  the  Limit  putting  me  in  clear  first.  Second,  I  see  some  of  your  points,  and  Shelley  could  work.  I  just  think  Morgan  has  to  be  the  choice  now.  It  could  end  up  being  wrong,  but  Shelley  is  a  much  less  safe  and  much  more  long  term  choice.\n\n9.  I  stick  by  what  I  said.  Sting  shouldn't  be  wrestling  any  more.  He  doesn't  have  the  skill  or  the  presence  he  once  had.  He  is  just  a  symbol  being  hopelessly  dragged  around  by  TNA  desperately.\n\n10.  Wait,  so  no  Angle  then?  Then  it  will  probably  be  Sting.  If  not,  people  need  to  realize  that  Roode  has  feuded  with  Hardy  already.  He  has  feuded  with  Styles  already.  Basically,  that  means  it  is  someone  fresh  like  Austin  Aries  or  Samoa  Joe.  Or  it's  Anderson  who  has  been  built  to  it.  So  I  guess  I'll  say  I  hope  it's  Anderson  over  Sting,  but  it  will  probably  be  Sting."

0	"From:  Rogers  v.  Bellei,  401  U.  S.  815,  831-3  (1971)(a  case  involving  statutory  citizenship  forfeiture,  discussing  dual  citizenship/dual  allegiance):\n\n"The  Congress  has  an  appropriate  concern  with  problems  attendant  on  dual  nationality.  Savornan  v.  United  States,  338  U.  S.  491,  338  U.  S.  500  (1950);  N.  Bar-Yaacov,  Dual  Nationality  xi  and  4  (1961).  These  problems  are  particularly  acute  when  it  is  the  father  who  is  the  child's  alien  parent  and  the  father  chooses  to  have  his  family  reside  in  the  country  of  his  own  nationality.  The  child  is  reared,  at  best,  in  an  atmosphere  of  divided  loyalty.  We  cannot  say  that  a  concern  that  the  child's  own  primary  allegiance  is  to  the  country  of  his  birth  and  of  his  father's  allegiance  is  either  misplaced  or  arbitrary.\n\nThe  duality  also  creates  problems  for  the  governments  involved.  MR.  JUSTICE  BRENNAN  recognized  this  when,  concurring  in  Kennedy  v.  Mendoza-Martinez,  372  U.  S.  144,  372  U.  S.  187  (1963),  a  case  concerning  native-born  citizens,  he  observed:  "We  have  recognized  the  entanglements  which  may  stem  from  dual  allegiance.  .  .  ."  In  a  famous  case,  MR.  JUSTICE  DOUGLAS  wrote  of  the  problem  of  dual  citizenship.  Kawakita  v.  United  States,  343  U.  S.  717,  343  U.  S.  723-736  (1952).  He  noted  that  "[o]ne  who  has  a  dual  nationality  will  be  subject  to  claims  from  both  nations,  claims  which  at  times  may  be  competing  or  conflicting,"  id.  at  343  U.  S.  733;  that  one  with  dual  nationality  cannot  turn  that  status  "into  a  fair-weather  citizenship,"  id.  at  343  U.  S.  736;  and  that  "[c]ircumstances  may  compel  one  who  has  a  dual  nationality  to  do  acts  which  otherwise  would  not  be  compatible  with  the  obligations  of  American  citizenship,"  ibid.\n  ....                      [CONTINUING]"

These  are  the  same  people  who  think  gays  should  be  executed,  atheists  should  have  their  citizenship  revoked,  and  that  the  first  amendment  means  you  have  the  freedom  to  choose  what  type  of  Christian  you  want  to  be.  They  say  they  want  to  return  us  to  a  "Christian  Nation"  and  that  we  need  to  base  our  laws  on  Old  Testament  Biblical  Law.  Go  back  and  look  at  some  of  the  stuff  Bryan  Fischer,  Mike  Huckabee,  Michele  Bachmann,  and  Sarah  Palin  have  both  said  and  endorsed.  Look  at  some  of  the  statements  Rick  Perry\\'s  advisers  have  made,  and  things  Jim  DeMint  has  said.  They  feel  they  have  been  commanded  to  take  over  government,  the  entertainment  industry,  the  church,  etc.  \\xc2\\xa0These  people  have  more  influence  than  they  should,  and  enough  to  be  dangerous.  Their  followers  are  probably  naive  when  it  comes  to  what  their  leaders  are  advocating  and  will  continue  to  push  their  agenda  without  considering  the  consequences.  Some  of  the  Tea  Party  have  tried  to  introduce  legislation  to  pass  personhood  amendments  (which  are  bad  enough)  but  also  to  charge  women  with  felony  murder  if  they  miscarry  but  are  unable  to  prove  they  had  nothing  to  do  with  it.  I  have  no  idea  how  they  would  go  about  autopsying  an  8  week  old  fetus,  but  women  would  be  guilty  until  proven  innocent.  Please  see  last  part  of  post  in  regards  to  capital  punishment.  This  is  what  DeMint  and  crew  advocate.  These  people  are  dangerous,  and  over  45%  of  the  House  of  Representatives  either  actively  endorse,  or  are  sympathetic,  to  these  nuts:\\n\\n\\nhttp://blog.christianitytoday.com/ctpolitics/2011/02/evangelicals_an_1.html\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nFor  some  fun  reading,  here  are  some  links:  "prenatal  murder"\\xc2\\xa0\\nhttp://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/02/26/georgia-lawmakers-anti-abortion-proposal-punish-women-miscarriages/\\n\\nall  sorts  of  craziness  linked  on  this  website:\\xc2\\xa0\\nhttp://www.rightwingwatch.org/\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nhttp://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/08/14/dominionism-michele-bachmann-and-rick-perry-s-dangerous-religious-bond.html\\xc2\\xa0\\nhttp://www.theocracywatch.org/biblical_law2.htm\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nhttp://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v08n1/chrisre1.html\\xc2\\xa0\\n\\nCapital  PunishmentEpitomizing  the  Reconstructionist  idea  of  Biblical  "warfare"  is  the  centrality  of  capital  punishment  under  Biblical  Law.  Doctrinal  leaders  (notably  Rushdoony,  North,  and  Bahnsen)  call  for  the  death  penalty  for  a  wide  range  of  crimes  in  addition  to  such  contemporary  capital  crimes  as  rape,  kidnapping,  and  murder.  Death  is  also  the  punishment  for  apostasy  (abandonment  of  the  faith),  heresy,  blasphemy,  witchcraft,  astrology,  adultery,  "sodomy  or  homosexuality,"  incest,  striking  a  parent,  incorrigible  juvenile  delinquency,  and,  in  the  case  of  women,  "unchastity  before  marriage."According  to  Gary  North,  women  who  have  abortions  should  be  publicly  executed,  "along  with  those  who  advised  them  to  abort  their  children."  Rushdoony  concludes:  "God\\'s  government  prevails,  and  His  alternatives  are  clear-cut:  either  men  and  nations  obey  His  laws,  or  God  invokes  the  death  penalty  against  them."  Reconstructionists  insist  that  "the  death  penalty  is  the  maximum,  not  necessarily  the  mandatory  penalty."  However,  such  judgments  may  depend  less  on  Biblical  Principles  than  on  which  faction  gains  power  in  the  theocratic  republic.  The  potential  for  bloodthirsty  episodes  on  the  order  of  the  Salem  witchcraft  trials  or  the  Spanish  Inquisition  is  inadvertently  revealed  by  Reconstructionist  theologian  Rev.  Ray  Sutton,  who  claims  that  the  Reconstructed  Biblical  theocracies  would  be  "happy"  places,  to  which  people  would  flock  because  "capital  punishment  is  one  of  the  best  evangelistic  tools  of  a  society."The  Biblically  approved  methods  of  execution  include  burning  (at  the  stake  for  example),  stoning,  hanging,  and  "the  sword."  Gary  North,  the  self-described  economist  of  Reconstructionism,  prefers  stoning  because,  among  other  things,  stones  are  cheap,  plentiful,  and  convenient.  Punishments  for  non-capital  crimes  generally  involve  whipping,  restitution  in  the  form  of  indentured  servitude,  or  slavery.  Prisons  would  likely  be  only  temporary  holding  tanks,  prior  to  imposition  of  the  actual  sentence.""

Bush's  administration.  If  this  "crash"  was  an  act  of  terror,  this  would  not  be  the  first  time  Kenyans  faced  acts  of  terror  due  to  their  alliance  with  the  US.  Remember  the  US  embassy  terror  bombings  in  the  late  1990's?  By  the  way  Kenya  is  80%  Christian  and  the  people  are  not  starving  to  death,  for  those  who  somehow  believe  Kenyans  are  all  terrorist  trying  to  destroy  America  because  Obama's  father  was  Kenyan.  Get  an  education  before  posting  "smart"  comments  about  a  nation  you  "smart"  posters  obviously  know  nothing  about.

S.  815,  831-3  (1971)  [CONTINUED]\n.....\n  "There  are  at  least  intimations  in  the  decided  cases  that  a  dual  national  constitutionally  may  be  required  to  make  an  election.  In  Perkins  v.  Elg,  307  U.  S.  325,  307  U.  S.  329  (1939),  the  Court  observed  that  a  native-born  citizen  who  had  acquired  dual  nationality  during  minority  through  his  parents'  foreign  naturalization  abroad  did  not  lose  his  United  States  citizenship  "provided  that,  on  attaining  majority,  he  elects  to  retain  that  citizenship  and  to  return  to  the  United  States  to  assume  its  duties."  In  Kawakita  v.  United  States,  343  U.S.  at  343  U.  S.  734,  the  Court  noted  that  a  dual  national,  "under  certain  circumstances,"  can  be  deprived  of  his  American  citizenship  through  an  Act  of  Congress.  In  Mandoli  v.  Acheson,  344  U.  S.  133,  344  U.  S.  138  (1952),  the  Court  took  pains  to  observe  that  there  was  no  statute  in  existence  imposing  an  election  upon  that  dual  nationality  litigant.\n\nThese  cases  do  not  flatly  say  that  a  duty  to  elect  may  be  constitutionally  imposed.  They  surely  indicate,  however,  that  this  is  possible,  and,  in  Mandoli,  the  holding  was  based  on  the  very  absence  of  a  statute,  and  not  on  any  theory  of  unconstitutionality.  And  all  three  of  these  cases  concerned  persons  who  were  born  here,  that  is,  persons  who  possessed  Fourteenth  Amendment  citizenship;  they  did  not  concern  a  person,  such  as  plaintiff  Bellei,  whose  claim  to  citizenship  is  wholly,  and  only,  statutory.""

After  all,  he\\'s  a  lawyer  and  needs  to  suck  it  up  -  but  of  course  he  doesn\\'t  want  people  to  know  he\\'s  an  attorney  since  that  might  spoil  his  choir  boy  image.    Newt  said  he  wasn\\'t  for  mandates  so  rick  needs  to  stop  promoting  it.    Besides,  rick  didn\\'t  mind  piling  on  with  Mitt  to  try  to  bury  Newt  early  on.    But  at  the  end  of  the  day,  what  solutions  does  rick  bring  to  the  table?  He  didn\\'t  do  anything  when  he  was  in  congress  and  time  after  time  he  ABANDONED  HIS  PRINCIPLES  TO  PLEASE  THE  LIBERALS  IN  PENNSYLVANIA!  And  what  did  it  buy  him?    A  19  point  drubbing  in  his  re-election!\\n\\nAs  for  the  campaign,  he\\'s  brought  no  rational  or  reasonable  solutions  to  the  table  -  instead,  like  mitt,  his  best  solution  has  been  to  say  "I  agree  with  Newt"    -  and  his  economic  logic  is  elementary  and  fatally  flawed.    Newt  has  been  spot  on  predicting  where  king  hussein  obama  is  leading  us,  including  the  attack  on  the  church,  which  is  simply  the  avenue  to  establish  the  legal  precedent  that  the  WH  has  the  power  to  tell  us  -  all  of  us  -  how  to  act,  how  to  respond,  and  what  to  think!    That\\'s  the  real  issue  from  obama  and  his  henchwoman  michellivelli!    Not  only  will  rick  be  behind  on  tidal  wave  of  rot  that  will  flood  him  if  elected,  he  will  not  be  able  to  get  congress  to  do  a  darn  thing!    And  when  his  failed  4  years  are  over,  the  demonic  dems  will  come  back  to  power  with  a  vengence  by  simply  pointing  at  rick\\'s  miserable  record  and  lack  of  ability  to  lead  in  a  hail  storm  of  enemies  on  both  sides  of  him!    \\n\\nSo  rick  should  just  suck  it  up,  stop  whining  and  run  the  gauntlet  like  Newt  has  had  to  ...  if  he  can\\'t  stand  the  heat  then  he  can\\'t  lead  the  country!"
